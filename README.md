Tech Stack
Front end built using:
React | React Hooks / Context | Passport.js and OAuth
Why did you choose this framework?

We decided to utilize React and React Hooks library because of the power it can provide to our product. Utilizing the Hooks concpt by neglecting the use of writing a class was time-saving.
Deviding to use React Context was a simple and smart decision by our team mainly because of it being a big part of the React library. It gave us the ability to pass data through a component with ease. A great way to stream line writing code.
Front end deployed to http://groovn-frontend-prod.netlify.com/
Back end built using:
Apollo GraphQL - writing queries, combining APIs and databases
Node.js - JS runtime environent
Express - web framework for Node.js
MongoDB - database
Mongoose - query building and schema
APIs
Spotify API
We decided to use the Spotify API mainly for build time and production. We wanted our users to have the ability to create a playlist and play their music. By using Spotify's API, it's based on REST principles and the endpoints return JSON metadata about music artists, albums, and tracks, directly from the Spotify Data Catalogue. It also provides access to user related data, like playlists and music that the user saves in their music library.

class SpotifyAPI extends RESTDataSource { constructor() { super(); this.baseURL = 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/me'; }

async getSavedTracks(token) { return await this.get('tracks', null, { headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer ' + token, }, }); } }

export default SpotifyAPI;

Context API
We used the Context API solely-based on using the React library. Utilizing Context, it creates an object for us. Once React renders a componentk that subscribes to a Context object, it will read the context value closest to the matching Provider above in the tree.

export default function App() { return (

); }

Testing
Testing of this application was very important and crucial for the overall success of the app and its functionality.

Each developer did a series of tests on both front-end and back-end to ensure the overall functionality was working. The following tests were completed throughout the build:

user authentication
routes
database
queries created
playlist creation
recommendation engine
recommended playlist
component functionality
In addition, all pull requests were reviewed by one or more team members, and merges were supervised by our project manager.

The application for the most part was set up to continuously deploy to Netlify and Heroku.
